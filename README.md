# Front End Self Study
Another repo for my self studying adventures but this time in Front End.

4.23.22 Started The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert by Jonas Schmedtmann. Set up dev environment, did basic "Hello World!" greeting and learned about values, variables and data types.

# Front End Self Study
Another repo for my self studying adventures but this time in Front End.

4.23.22 Started The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert by Jonas Schmedtmann. Set up dev environment, did basic "Hello World!" greeting and learned about values, variables and data types.

4.24.22 Worked on let, const, and var as well as basic operators.

4.24.22.2 Completed coding challenge number 1.

4.25.22 Worked on String and Template Literals, Taking Decisions: if/else Statements.

4.25.22.2 Began a YouTube tutorial for a simple JS ToDoList app.

4.26.22 Did a little of the YouTube tutorial but not very much at all.

4.28.22 Did Truthy & Falsy and Equality Operators.

4.30.22 Did some practice with functions using [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/function-basics) & [JavaScriptTutorial.net](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-function/). I still don't feel confident writing functions on my own, but I am determined to learn them.
